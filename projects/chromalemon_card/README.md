# chromalemon_card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

It is a business card with details like email and github on it, and a QR code which links to my LinkedIn page. It will allow people to visit my socials easily and will be memorable for them as it is quite cool.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

About 30 dollars.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
